👋 Hi, I'm Marius Ngaboyamahina, a Senior Software Engineer based in Accra, Rwanda. I have ten years of professional experience in software development, and I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology from the Kobe Institute of Computing.

💻 I specialize in software engineering, microservices architecture, and data science. Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I continuously seek new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I'm also a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning more about data science, expanding my knowledge, and looking to collaborate on data-related projects.

🌐 In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, traveling, and reading to learn new things.
